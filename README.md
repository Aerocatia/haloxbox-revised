# Halo CE - Revised (Xbox)
The "Revised" tagset provides bug fixes and quality improvements for the tags and data of Halo: Combat Evolved for the Xbox.

This project does not set out to make changes that affect the playstyle or atmosphere of the game.
The following types of changes should be expected:

- Provide a stable universal tagset that can be used to compile custom maps for any XBE version.
- Fix index out of bounds bugs.
- Fix zfighting of the powerup cores.
- Fix bitmap formats that result in lower quality bitmaps for no reason.
- Restore data lost during the extraction process using the PC editing kits as a source.

## XBE version support
Cache files (maps) can be compiled (in English) for the following game versions from these tags:

- 01.10.12.2276 (2001-10-12) (NTSC USA)
- Official Xbox Magazine Demo (2002-02-26) (NTSC USA)
- 01.03.14.0009 (2002-03-14) (NTSC Japan)
- 01.12.09.0135 (2002-12-09) (NTSC Asia)

Later game builds offer slightly more tag space and can be more useful for custom content.
