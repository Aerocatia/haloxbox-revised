This directory contains tags that are no-longer part of any build target for various reasons.
They are stored here to preserve them should anyone want to use them.
### /old_bitmaps
This contains bitmaps that have been replaced in the main tagset.

The tags are as follows:

- At some point in 2002 Bungie themselves fixed the sniper scope to say 2x - 8x for later Xbox builds. This is the previous 2x - 10x texture from the earlier Xbox releases.

```

- A blue-accented version of the plasma pistol. They were used on Xbox before being corrected to green for PC.
